# Master of Christian Ministry (2 years, 60 credit hours)

The objective of this program is to provide fundamental training for those preparing for full-time or part-time ministry. It is not as comprehensive as the M.Div. program, but focuses on practical and Biblical courses. Students are required to participate in the spiritual exercises provided by the seminary, and to fulfill a one-year field education requirement before graduation.
