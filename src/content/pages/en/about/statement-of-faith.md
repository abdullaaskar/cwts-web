title: Statement of Faith
---

The Christian Witness Theological Seminary had been brought into being to propagate the Christian faith through biblical, theological, spiritual and ministerial training. The Christian faith which undergirds the purpose of this corporation is codified in the following:

1. There is one true God, infinite and perfect; existing eternally in three persons:Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
2. Jesus Christ is true God and true man. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and was born of the virgin Mary. He died upon the cross, the just for the unjust, as a substitutionary sacrifice; and all who believe in Him are justified on the ground of His shed blood. Having risen from the dead according to Scripture, He is now at the right hand of the Father as our great High Priest, and will come again to establish His kingdom of righteousness and peace.
3. The Holy Spirit, co-equal with the Father and the Son, is the Giver of life to all creation. He spoke through the Prophets and indwells and empowers all believers.
4. The 66 books of the Old and New Testaments were verbally inspired by God. They are the authoritative and inerrant Word of God, for the salvation of the human race, constituting the only rule of Christian faith and conduct. They are to be interpreted based on the meaning of the text as intended by the author (both God and the human authors inspired by God).
5. God is the creator of human beings in His image, male and female. He is the author of marriage defined as the union between one man and one woman in a life-long, exclusive, and caring commitment to each other.
6. Man, created in the image of God, fell through disobedience, and brought separation from God to all human beings. Hence all are dead in sin, and can only be saved through the regenerative work of the Holy Spirit. The final state of the unbeliever is existence in conscious torment; and that of the believer, everlasting joy and bliss.
7. Human beings are saved by grace, through faith in Jesus Christ, the only Savior. To all who receive Him, He gives power to become children of God.
8. It is the will of God that each believer be filled with the Holy Spirit, sanctified and dedicated to God in life and service. The progressive experience towards spiritual maturity in the life of the believer is a process that is subsequent to justification.
9. The Church as the Body of Christ consists of all believers, with Christ being the Head.
10. The Lord Jesus Christ will return. There will be a bodily resurrection of the just and of the unjust; for the former, a resurrection unto life; for the latter, a Resurrection unto judgment. Christ will establish His holy and glorious kingdom and take the believer to be with God forever. This is the believerâ€™s blessed hope and a vital incentive for holy living and faithful service.
